## ✨ About me
Hi, I'm Louis Johnson - feel free to call me Louis. *You might see a different name when working with me, but I prefer to keep it private and rarely mention it in conversation.*

I'm a high school student in Vietnam with a strong love for software development and software architecture. I enjoy designing systems and turning ideas into clean, functional, and modular code.

## 🛠️ Skills
- Primary language: TypeScript (6 years of experience).
- Strong focus on scalable, type-safe, and maintainable systems.
- I work across the full stack, but I especially enjoy building and designing APIs.

## 💡 What I care about
- ⚡ Making products that feel fast, simple, and predictable to use.
- 🧩 Designing systems that are flexible without being over-engineered.
- 🧠 Trading clever code for clarity when it matters.
- 🐞 Being able to debug and improve systems long after they ship.
- 🌱 Contributing to and learning from open source software.
